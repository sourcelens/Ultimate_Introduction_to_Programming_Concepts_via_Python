1 : In the above program the definition of the function reverse is from____?  

a) Line 1 to Line 9  
b) Line 1 to Line 5   
c) Line 7 to Line 9   
d) None of the Above  

**Answer** b) 

**Description**

Here the function definition is from Line 1 to Line 5. Because Line 1 to Line 5 comes under the keyword def. def keyword is used for defining a function in python.

```
def reverse(s):
    str = ""
    for i in s:
        str = i + str
    return str

stringone = "String to reverse"
print(stringone)
print(reverse(stringone))
```

2 : Which is the argument we are passing to the function reverse in Line 9?  

a) stringone   
b) reverse  
c) Both of the above  
d) None of the above  

**Answer** a) 

**Description**

We are calling the function in Line 9 and passing the argument stringone.  

---
---


```
def reverse(s):
    str = ""
    for i in s:
        str = i + str
    return str

stringone = "String to reverse"
print(stringone)
print(reverse(stringone))
```

3 : When we are calling the function in this program?  

a) Line 8  
b) Line 9   
c) Line 1   
d) Line 7  

**Answer** b) 

**Description**

Here we are calling the function in Line 9 as print(reverse(stringone)). It will print the return value of the function.  

---
---


```
def reverse(s):
    str = ""
    for i in s:
        str = i + str
    return str

stringone = "String to reverse"
print(stringone)
print(reverse(stringone))
```

4 : In Line 4 we are doing_____?  

a) Adding strings   
b) Concatenating strings  
c) Both of the above  
d) None of the above  

**Answer** b) 

**Description**

In Line 4 we are concatenating strings. In case of strings, + sign indicates concatenation.  

---
---


```
def reverse(s):
    str = ""
    for i in s:
        str = i + str
    return str

stringone = "String to reverse"
print(stringone)
print(reverse(stringone))
```

5 : Will str = i + str and str = str + i give the same result?  

a) Will give same result  
b) Will give different result  
c) Any result   
d) None of the above  

**Answer** b) 

**Description**

As in addition in which a + b is same as b + a, in concatenation it will give different result. So, str = i + str and str = str + i will give different result. Here in this program str = i + str will reverse the string but str = str + i will give the same string and will not reverse it.

---
---


```
def reverse(s):
    str = ""
    for i in s:
        str = i + str
    return str

stringone = "String to reverse"
print(stringone)
print(reverse(stringone)
```

6 : In the above program what we are doing in Line 2?  

a) Assigning empty string to variable str  
b) Calling function reverse  
c) Both of the above  
d) None of the above  

**Answer** a) 

**Description**

In Line 2 str = ““, we are assigning an empty string to the variable “str”.
