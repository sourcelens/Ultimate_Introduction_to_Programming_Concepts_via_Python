1 : The above lines of code are meant for___________?  

a) Exception handling   
b) Nested looping  
c) To print Functions   
d) None of the above  

**Answer** a) 

**Description**  

This is the code which handles a simple exception. Syntax is ‘try’ and a piece of code and ‘except’. There are two keywords try and except like if…. else. Here we are trying division by zero but it is not defined in mathematics. This will cause something called an exception and that is being handled here.

2 : In programming, what are Interrupts?  

a) Something which stops the execution of a program    
b) Something which stops Debugging of a program  
c) Something which starts the execution of a program  
d) None of the above  

 **Answer** a) 

**Description**

A program i.e., set of instructions which is running on a CPU will not stop until and unless an interrupt come to the CPU. Until and unless an interrupt comes, the program will keep running.

3 : What are the different types of Interrupts?  

a) Software and Hardware  
b) Internal and External   
c) User created   
d) None of the above  

**Answer** a) 

**Description**

There are two types of interrupts. Software interrupts and hardware interrupts. Software interrupts are instructions which can cause interrupts. In case of software interrupts the execution of the program is halted. Otherwise, the program keeps executing. Hardware interrupt is generated by some hardware devices connected to the CPU.

4 : Interrupts generated by a NIC card is called_________?  

a) Hardware Interrupts   
b) Software Interrupts  
c) User created Interrupts  
d) None of the above  

  **Answer** a) 

 **Description**  

Hardware interrupt is generated by some hardware devices connected to the CPU like hard disk, NIC card etc. They change the voltages in some of the pins of the CPU. In that case again the execution of the program is halted at some point and the execution is changed to some other program. Operating system can’t call an interrupt handler.

#Exceptionhandling

try:
    numerator = 10
    denominator = 0

    result = numerator / denominator

    print(result)
except:
    print("Error : Denominator cannot be 0.")
```

5 : In the above lines of code which type of interrupt is created by Line 7 numerator/denominator?  

a) Hardware Interrupts  
b) Software Interrupts   
c) User created Interrupts   
d) None of the above  

**Answer** b) 

**Description** 

Here we have division by zero which is not defined in mathematics. This is a software interrupt that needs to be handled by an interrupt handler. So, when this interrupt comes, the program execution is halted and an interrupt handler is executed which is always in the operating system, which means that line is ignored. Later it may get executed or never get executed. As soon as this line is executed the control is gone from python program and the control is gone to the operating system because the interrupt handler is executed. Now the operating system can decide execute Line 9 or something else.

 6 : Premature ending of a program is called_____?

 a) Crashing  
 b) Quit   
 c) Ending  
 d) None of the above  

   **Answer** a) 

 **Description**

 Premature ending of a program is called Crashing and it occurs if proper exception handling is not done.

 7 : What is the difference between if…. else and try…. except?  

 a) If…else does not necessarily interact with the OS but try…except interacts with operating system  
 b) Both are working in same manner    
 c) We never come to except: until if occurs   
 d) None of the above  

 **Answer** a) 

 **Description**  

try...except involves exception handling that interacts with the operating system (OS), whereas if...else does not necessarily interact with the OS. if...else statements are purely for decision-making within the program itself.

 8 : Select one reason for , why we Use Exception Handling Instead of If-Else Statements?  

 a) Readability of the code   
 b) To save running time   
 c) To control program flow  
 d) None of the above  

 **Answer** a) 

 **Description**

The main use of exception handling is readability of the code. The code looks a lot cleaner this way.  If-else statements for error checking can clutter the main logic of the program, making it harder to understand and maintain, especially as the number of error conditions increases.
