1 : c = a + b          In the above code which one is correct?  

a) First a + b, then it will be assigned to c  
b) First a is assigned to c, then b is added to it  
c) Both can happen    
d) None of the above      

**Answer** a) 

**Description**

In this Python program a + b will happen first, that is b is added to a and then this sum will be assigned to the variable c.

2 : d = a* b          In the above code which one is correct?  

a) First a * b, then it will be assigned to d  
b) First a is assigned to d, then b is multiplied to it  
c) Both can happen    
d) None of the above    

**Answer** a) 

**Description**

In this Python program a * b will happen first, that is b is multiplied to a and then this output will be assigned to the variable d.

3 : e = a – b         In the above code which one is correct?  

a) First a - b, then it will be assigned to e  
b) First a is assigned to e, then b is subtracted from it  
c) Both can happen    
d) None of the above    

**Answer** a) 

**Description**

In this Python program a - b will happen first, that is b is subtracted from a and then this will be assigned to the variable e.

4 : f = a / b          In the above code which one is correct?  

a) First a / b, then it will be assigned to f  
b) First a is assigned to f, then it is divided with b  
c) Both can happen    
d) None of the above    

**Answer** a) 

**Description**

In this Python program a / b will happen first, that is a is divided by b and then this quotient will be assigned to the variable f.

5 : a = 10

b = 20

g = a == b

What will be the Boolean value of g in the above Python code?

a) True  
b) False  

**Answer** b) 

**Description**

In the above code ‘ = = ‘ is a comparison operator. It compares whether a &amp; b are equal and assign its Boolean value to g. Here a = 10 &amp; b = 20, they are not equal. So, the Boolean value of g will be false.

6 : a = 15

b = 15

h = a == b

What will be the Boolean value of h in the above Python code?

a) True  
b) False  

**Answer** a) 

**Description**

In the above code ‘ = = ‘ is a comparison operator. It compares whether a &amp; b are equal and assign its Boolean value to h. Here a = 15 &amp; b = 15, they are equal. So, the Boolean value of g will be true.

7 : a = 20

b = 15

i = a > b

What will be the Boolean value of i in the above Python code?  

a) True    
b) False      

**Answer** a)   

**Description**

In the above code ‘ > ‘ is a comparison operator. It checks whether a is greater than b. Here a is 20 &amp; b is 15. So Boolean value of i will be true.

8 : Automatic conversion to float in division will happen in which of the following language/s?  

a) C  
b) Python  
c) Both of the above  
d) None of the above  

**Answer** b)   

**Description**

This happens in Python. It is the magic of the language Python. It finds that you are doing a division and decimal points may be needed.

9 : a = 20

b = 15

j = a < b

What will be the Boolean value of j in the above Python code? 

a) True    
b) False      

**Answer** b)   

**Description**

In the above code ‘ < ‘ is a comparison operator. It checks whether a is less than b. Here a is 20 &amp; b is 15, so a is not less than b. So Boolean value of j will be false.
