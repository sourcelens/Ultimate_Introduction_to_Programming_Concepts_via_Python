```
fruits = [ "apple", "orange", "mango", "grapes"]
for f in fruits:
    if (f == "apple"):
        print (f)
```

1 : In the above program which all will get printed on to the screen?  

a) ‘apple’  
b) ‘orange’  
c) ‘mango’  
d) All of the above  

**Answer** a) 

**Description** 

In the program it will iterate through all of the four fruits because there is a for loop, but only print ‘apple’. This is because we are giving an if condition that f = = ‘apple’, then print. So, only apple will get printed.
