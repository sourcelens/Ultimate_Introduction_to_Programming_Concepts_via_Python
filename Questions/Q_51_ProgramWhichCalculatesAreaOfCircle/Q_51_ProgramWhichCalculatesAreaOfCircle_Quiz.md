```
import math
r = 2
area = math.pi * r * r
print ("Area = ", area)
```

1 : Here in the above program what we are doing in Line 1?  

a) Importing a library called math   
b) Importing a function called math   
c) Importing a variable called math   
d) All of the above  

**Answer** a) 

**Description** 

Here we are importing a library called math which is there in Python.  

---
---


```
import math
r = 2
area = math.pi * r * r
print ("Area = ", area)
```

2 : In the above program we are calculating the _______  

a) Area of a square   
b) Area of a circle   
c) Area of a rectangle   
d) None of the above  

**Answer** b) 

**Description**

This program calculates the area of a circle. Pi r square is the formula to calculate the area of a circle. Here we are multiplying pi * r * r.  

---
---


```
import math
r = 2
area = math.pi * r * r
print ("Area = ", area)
```

3 : In this program we are using math library to _______  

a) get the value of pi with precision   
b) get the radius of a circle   
c) Both of the above   
d) None of the above  

**Answer** a) 

**Description**

pi is an irrational number. It has infinite digits and is a universal constant. To get high precision we are importing it from the math library.

```
num = 10
for i in range (num):
    print (i)
```

4 : In the above program what will get printed?  

a) Numbers from 0 to 9   
b) Numbers from 1 to 9   
c) Number from 0 to 10   
d) Number from 1 to 10  

**Answer** a) 

**Description**

Range here starts from 0 and will end in 9. So, the loop will print numbers from 0 to 9.  

---
---


```
num = 10
for i in range (2, num, 3):
    print (i)
```

5 : In the above program what will get printed?  

a) 2, 5, 8   
b) 0 to 9   
c) 2, 5   
d) 5, 8  

**Answer** a) 

**Description**  

Here we are giving the start of the range as 2 and step as 3 and giving up to 10. So, printing will be 2, 5, 8.  

---
---


```
num = 12
for i in range (2, num, 3):
    print (i)
```

6 : In the above program what will get printed?  

a) 2, 5, 8   
b) 0 to 9   
c) 2, 5   
d) 2, 5, 8, 11  

**Answer** d) 

**Description**

Here we are giving the start of the range as 2 and step as 3 and giving upto 12. So, printing will be 2, 5, 8, 11
