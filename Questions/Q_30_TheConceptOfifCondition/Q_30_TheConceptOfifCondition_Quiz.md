```
raintoday = 1
if (raintoday == 1):
    print ("Take umbrella")
```

1 : In the above program what will be the output?  

a) Printing “Take umbrella”  
b) No output  
c) Doesn’t work  
d) None of the above  

**Answer** a) 

**Description**  

It will print “Take umbrella” because the if condition will evaluate as true. We assigned the value 1 to raintoday. So, if true is evaluated print will execute.

```
raintoday = 1
if (raintoday == 1):
    print ("Take umbrella")
```

2 : In the above program which Boolean value will be evaluated at Line 2?  

a) True  
b) False  

**Answer** a) 

**Description** 

Here we are giving raintoday a value of 1 and we are checking whether raintoday is 1. So, Boolean value will be true.

---
---


```
raintoday = 0
if (raintoday == 1):
    print ("Take umbrella")
```

3 : In the above program which Boolean value will be evaluated at Line 2?  

a) True  
b) False  

**Answer** b) 

**Description**

In the given program, the expression within the if statement that will be evaluated is at Line 2 is (raintoday == 1). This expression checks if the variable raintoday is equal to 1. Since raintoday is assigned 0 at the start, this expression evaluates to the Boolean value False. Thus, the code inside the if block will not execute, and the program will not print "Take umbrella".

```
raintoday = 1
if (raintoday > 1):
    print ("Take umbrella")
```

4 : In the above program what will be the output?  

a) Printing “Take umbrella”    
b) No output  
c) Any of the above  
d) None of the above  

**Answer** b) 

**Description**

It will not print “Take umbrella” because the if condition will evaluate as false. We assigned the value 1 to raintoday and we are checking raintoday is greater than 1. So, if false is evaluated print doesn’t execute. So, no output.  

---
---


```
raintoday = 2
if (raintoday > 1):
    print ("Take umbrella")
```

5 : In the above program what will be the output?  

a) Printing “Take umbrella”  
b) No output  
c) Doesn’t work  
d) None of the above  

**Answer** a) 

**Description**

Here we are giving raintoday a value of 2 and we are checking whether raintoday is greater than 1. So, Boolean value will be true and it will print “Take umbrella”.   

---
---


```
raintoday = 2
if (raintoday < 3):
    print ("Take umbrella")
```

6 : In the above program what will be the output?

a) Printing “Take umbrella”  
b) No output  
c) Doesn’t work  
d) None of the above  

**Answer** a) 

**Description**

Here we are giving raintoday a value of 2 and we are checking whether raintoday is less than 3. So, Boolean value will be true and it will print “Take umbrella”.
