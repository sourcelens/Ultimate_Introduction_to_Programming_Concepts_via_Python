1 : What do Line 4,5,6 in the above program does?  

a) Adding two variables  
b) Swapping two variables   
c) Multiplying two variables   
d) None of the above  

**Answer** b) 

**Descrption** 

This program is for swapping two variables. In the beginning a is given a value 10 and b is having value 20. After execution a will have 20 and b will have 10. We are doing this by using a temporary variable, here it is temp. We are first assigning the value of b to temp (Line 4). Then we are putting the value of a to b (Line 5). Then we put the value of temp to a (Line 6). Thus, the values will get swapped.  

---
---


```
a = 10
b = 20

temp = b
b = a
a = temp

print(a)
print(b)
```

2 : What will be the value of temp after executing Line 4?  

a) 10  
b) 20   
c) 30   
d) 40  

**Answer** b) 

**Descrption** 

In Line 4 we are assigning the value of b to the variable temp. The value of b at start was 20. So, now temp will become 20.

---
---


```
a = 10
b = 20

temp = b
b = a
a = temp

print(a)
print(b)
```

3 : What will be the value of b after executing Line 5?  

a) 10  
b) 20  
c) 30   
d) 40  

**Answer** a) 

**Descrption** 

In Line 5 we are assigning the value of a to b. The value of a initially was 10. Now as we are assigning it to b, b will become 10.  

---
---


```
a = 10
b = 20

temp = b
b = a
a = temp

print(a)
print(b)
```

4 : What will be the value of a after the execution of Line 6?  

a) 10  
b) 20  
c) 30  
d) 40  

**Answer** b) 

**Descrption**

In Line 6 we are assigning the value of temp to a. In Line 4 we assigned the value of b to temp and temp became 20. So, now the value 20 is assigned to a in Line 6. So, a becomes 20.

---
---


```
a = 10
b = 20

temp = b
b = a
a = temp

print(a)
print(b)
```

5 : What will get printed for a & b in Line 8 & Line 9?  

a) a = 20 

   b = 10  

b) a = 10 

   b = 20  

c) a = 20 

   b = 30  

d) a = 30

   b = 20  

**Answer** a) 

**Descrption**

This program is for swapping two variables. At start a is giving a value 10 and b is having value 20. After execution a will have 20 and b will have 10. We are doing this by using a temporary variable, here it is temp. We are first assigning the value of b to temp (Line 4). Then we are putting the value of a to b (Line 5). Then we put the value of temp to a (Line 6). Thus, they will get swapped. So, a will become 20 and b will become 10.

---
---


```
a = 10
b = 20

b = a + b
a = b - a
b = b - a

print(a)
print(b)
```

6 : In the above program what will be the value of b after execution of Line 4?  

a) 20   
b) 10   
c) 30   
d) 40  

**Answer** c) 

**Descrption**

In Line 4 We are adding both a &amp; b and assigning it to b. So, a is 10 &amp; b is 20 &amp; a + b will be 30. It is assigned to b in Line 4. So, b will become 30.

---
---


```
a = 10
b = 20

b = a + b
a = b - a
b = b - a

print(a)
print(b)
```

7 : What will be the value of a after the execution of Line 5?  

a) 10   
b) 20  
c) 30  
d) 40   

**Answer** b) 

**Descrption**

In Line 5 we are subtracting the value of a from b. b has become 30 in Line 4. a is 10. So, we are subtracting 30 – 10 which is 20.  

---
---


```
a = 10
b = 20

b = a + b
a = b - a
b = b - a

print(a)
print(b)
```

8 : What will be the value of b after the execution of Line 6?  

a) 10   
b) 20   
c) 30  
d) 40  

**Answer** a) 

**Descrption**

In Line 6 we are doing b – a and assigning it to b. Here a will be 20, because in Line 5 we are doing b – a (30 – 10) and assigning it to a. The value of b is 30, because in Line 4 we are adding a &amp; b which is 10 + 20 = 30 and assigning it to b. So, in Line 6 we are doing b – a which will be 30 – 20 and it is 10. S0, b will become 10.  

---
---


```
a = 10
b = 20

b = a + b
a = b - a
b = b - a

print(a)
print(b)
```

9 : The logic of this program is not universal and is not applicable for _______  

a) Numbers   
b) Strings  
c) Both of the above  
d) None of the above  

**Answer** b) 

**Descrption**

This logic is not applicable for strings. It is only applicable for numbers. We can’t do subtraction of strings.
