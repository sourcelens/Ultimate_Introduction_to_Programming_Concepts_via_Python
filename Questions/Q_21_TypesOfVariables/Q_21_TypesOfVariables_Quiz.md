3 : What are the different variable types based on size?  

a) 8 bit  
b) 16 & 32 bit  
c) 64 bit  
d) All of the above  

**Answer** d) 

**Description**  

a) Based on size we have different types of variables like 8 bit, 16 bit, 32 bit, 64 bit, probably more than that. If you don’t want to waste too much memory, you can use 8 bit and if you have bigger data to store, you can use bigger memory bits.

4 : Based on usage variables are divided into _______  

a) Signed  
b) unsigned  
c) Both of the above  
d) None of the above  

**Answer** c) 

**Description**  

a) In the signed one we can store negative values like -1, -100 & so on. In unsigned one we can represent one without signs.

b) In the signed one we can store negative values like -1, -100 & so on. In unsigned one we can represent one without signs.

c) In the signed one we can store negative values like -1, -100 & so on. In unsigned one we can represent one without signs.

d) It is not correct.
